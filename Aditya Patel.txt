Aditya’s Form design is very appealing of having a black, light and dark grey background colors and writing while there is one green button that says, “Add City”. 
The database has 4 buttons that connects to the database of:
•	LowPop
•	HighPop
•	AvgPop
•	TotalPop
There is no “Exit” button except for little red and blue icons on the top, right side of the database that’s across from the title, “Population”. 
Additionally, there is a sort button along with a combo box beside it. However, the text of the ‘MainForm’ is titled, “Population” without including the 
word “database” to not cause confusion to users when using the database itself. File name of submitting the assignment wasn’t met because it’s titled, “Population”; 
instead it should have been titled, “APatel-Lab-2” like the course addendum showed at the very last page when submitting the assignment [highlighted in yellow].

The code, inside the Form design is neat with assigned buttons. However, the comments is shown for what action would happen at the beginning but has not been said 
what the rest of the buttons do. Additionally, there is no mdf file except for
•	CityDBDataSet.xsd
•	CityDBDataSet.Designer.cs
•	CityDBDataSet.xsc
•	CityDBDataSet.xss

Upon running the program, I received an error on line 18 of “Exception Unhandled” because it is missing the main piece of the database program which is the Access
'mdf' file that brings the database and windows form together to make it work. I did click “Continue” which led me to exit the program. 
Thus, conducting the program has lead a short, uncompleted program.

Overall the assignment is considered half completed base off of missing the main 'mdf' file that goes with the other four DataSet’s. 
The appearance is passing but making the program run would make the assignment pass. Comparing my assignment to Aditya’s is that I need to have time 
to make my appearance form [design] like something like that because it shows dedication. Even if the program didn’t run correctly, the assignment shows 
progress of trying to make the program work while also making it appealing to the use’s eye.
