I cloned Adityaâ€™s repository and it was unable to compile due to the mdf file being missing. When I inspected his code, it was readable and reasonably documented. I did notice that it did lack some comments for the population statistics code, but I found it was relatively simple and still easy to read.

One thing that Aditya did different was include a drop-down menu for the various sort options. I like this and wish I had done it with my program, as I had used buttons for each sort option.
