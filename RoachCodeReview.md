The code would not run due to an unhandled exception on line 18,
this is likely due to a data source issue.

The code is readable and documented well, more documentation would be nice for structure.
Adding comments in the button logic for example would help.

There isn't any repetitive code, however there is some unused commented out lines
which could be removed if not needed to clean up the code.
There is also a save button that isn't referenced on line 77.

A suggested improvement would be to add more input validation.

The UI is structured well and easily readable.
